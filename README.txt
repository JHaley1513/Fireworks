Light up your screen with Fireworks! Launch enough of it to trigger a BIG surprise

For this project, we recorded fireworks sounds using various household objects as well as sounds downloaded from the web. The main script for generating fireworks on-screen was taken from https://codepen.io/whqet/pen/Auzch. Audio integration, styling and page layout, and the progress bar feature, were implemented by us.
